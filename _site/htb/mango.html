<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<img class="htbCard" src="../assets/htb/Mango/card.png" alt="mango.html Card">

<p>
  Mango is a <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack The Box</a> machine and has the IP address 10.10.10.162. It was released on the 26. October 2019, uses a <span class="htbTool">Linux</span> OS and is categorized as a <i>medium</i> machine.
</p>

<p>
  This box features some really nice learning opportunities, especially during the <a href="#foothold">Foothold step</a>. Actually, getting the foothold is the hardest part of this machine and the rest is quite easy. However, I really enjoyed the techniques that were necessary to solve this challenge and it's one of my favourite <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack The Box</a> machines I've done so far.
</p>

<h2 id="enum">Enumeration</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is to enumerate and gather information about the box. One of the most important tools is the port scanner <span class="htbTool">nmap</span>. I like to run it with the parameters <span class="htbTool">-T4 -A -p-</span> to get a thorough scan:</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/nmap.png" alt="Mango nmap "> <span>nmap -T4 -A -p- 10.10.10.162</span> </div>

<p>
  There are three ports open on Mango:
</p>

<table class="htbTwoColumn">
  <tr>
    <td>Port 22 - ssh:</td>
    <td>ssh is rarely a direct way to attack HTB boxes, so I ignore that for now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Port 80 – Apache httpd 2.4.29:</td>
    <td>An Apache webserver that seems to be running a website with the title <b>Mango | Sweet &amp; Juicy</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Port 443 - Apache httpd 2.4.29</td>
    <td>Another Apache webserver, but this time over SSL and with the title <b>Mango | Search Base</b>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The SSL certificate reveals the vhost <i>staging-order.mango.htb</i>, so I add <i>10.10.10.162 mango.htb</i> and <i>10.10.10.162 staging-order.mango.htb</i> to the <i>/etc/hosts</i> file of my Kali VM.
</p>

<h3>Port 443 – Apache httpd 2.4.29 webserver:</h3>

Let's check out the website served on port 443 in the browser by surfing to <i>https://mango.htb:</i>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/website.jpg" alt="Mango Website on port 443"> <span>The website serverd on port 443</span> </div>

<p>
  The page we find here is reminiscent of Google's search engine. However, it has no functionality and pressing the buttons does nothing. In the top right, there are links to several other sections and the <i>Analytics</i> link actually leads to a seemingly interesting page. However, it is not necessary to exploit these pages to finish this box, so it seems like they are just a rabbit hole.
</p>

<h3>Port 80 - Apache httpd 2.4.29 webserver:</h3>

<p>
  Next, let's check out the non-SSL website hosted on the box. Surfing to <i>http://mango.htb</i> results in a <i>Forbidden</i> response code, but <i>http://staging-order.mango.htb</i> reveals the following login page:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/website80.jpg" alt="Mango Website on Port 80"> <span>The website served on port 443</span> </div>

<p>
  Trying out common credentials like username <i>admin</i> with password <i>admin</i> (and similar pairs) doesn't let us login. However, the page is vulnerable to an injection attack, which I'll describe in the <a href="#foothold">Foothold</a> section.
</p>

<h3>Additional enumeration steps</h3>

<p>
  Of course, I also used other tools and techniques during the enumeration phase, like enumerating the files and directories on the server with <span class="htbTool">dirbuster</span>, checking the source code of the pages and so on. I'm leaving these steps out of this write-up, since they did not reveal anything interesting.
</p>

<h2 id="foothold">Foothold</h2>

<p>
  To get onto the box, we have to exploit the login page presented at <i>http://staging-order.mango.htb</i>. First, let's start <span class="htbTool">Burpsuite</span> and see how the login attempts are handled by the site. This reveals that the username and password are transfered as simple POST parameters.
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/burp_login.png" alt="Mango Login request with Burpsuite"> <span>Login request with Burpsuite</span> </div>

<p>
  A good idea here is to test if an injection attack is possible. I first try out some common SQL injection attacks, but they don't lead me anywhere. I then remember that the name of boxes at <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack The Box</a> usually also allude to a technique or tool that is helpful to solve the challenge. The word <i>Mango</i> is quite close to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Django</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I hazard the guess that the server might be using a MongoDB database from this (which turns out to be the case). MongoDB is a NoSQL database, so of course SQL injection attacks don't work. However, there are also NoSQL injection attacks and <a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL Injection" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Github page</a> has a nice overview and collection of things to try.
</p>

<p>
  The simple bypass authentication trick mentioned there doesn't work, but the <a href="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20Injection#extract-data-information" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extract data information</a> section contains the right hints.
</p>

<p>
  Using regular expressions, it's possible to extract information from the database. By setting the <i>username</i> parameter to <i>username[$regex]</i>, I can use a regular expression to gather information about the usernames. I set the <i>password</i> parameter to <i>password[$ne]=1</i>, where <i>[$ne]</i> stands for <i>not equal</i>, hoping/assuming that no user simply has the password "1" (note that in a real-life attack you could deduce assumptions/rules like this from the password policy of the site). By using the regular expression <i>^a.*</i>, for example, I can check whether there is a user whose username starts with "a" - sending this request with Burpsuite, I get a 302 response code from the server:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/burp_regexA.png" alt="Mango Testing regular expression ^a.* with Burpsuite"> <span>Successful injection attack</span> </div>

<p>
  However, if I'm checking for a username starting with "z" using the regular expression <i>^z.*</i>, I get a 200 response code from the server, just like when trying out an incorrect username-password combination:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/burp_regexZ.png" alt="Mango Testing regular expression ^z.* with Burpsuite"> <span>Unsuccessful injection attack</span> </div>

<p>
  This way, it is possible to successively compute usernames registered in the database. For example, after getting the 302 response with <i>^a.*</i>, I can check whether there's a user whose name starts with "ab" with the regular expression <i>^ab.*</i>. When I get a 302 code again, I know that there must be such a user. If the server returns a 202 response, I know that there is no username that starts with "ab" and so on. This gives me list of candidate usernames to check out.
</p>

<p>
   For each of these candidates, I can check whether there's actually such a username by using <i>username=candidate&password[$ne]=1</i>, where <i>candidate</i> is a username that I want to test. If I get a 302 response here, I know there must be a user with exactly this username. If I get a 200 reponse code, then there's no such user.
</p>

<p>
  The same technique can be used to find the passwords of the users. Once I have a username (let's say <i>admin</i> is a valid name), it's possible to brute-force the password of the user character for character by setting <i>username=admin</i> and <i>password[$regex]=^a.*</i> iterating over all characters, checking the response codes in the same way as above. As long as I get at least one 302 response code, I know that I found a new character of the password. If I only get 200 responses for all characters, I know that I must have already found the complete password.
</p>

<p>
 Of course, this is something you don't want to do by hand. I therefore wrote a little <span class="htbTool">Python</span> script to do this work for me. You can find my script <a href="../assets/htb/Mango/noSQLexploit.py" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, but I suggest you try to write one yourself, since I think this is a great learning opportunity and it was a lot of fun to write this script :)
</p>

<p>
  My script returns this output and I now have two usernames and passwords:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/nosqlscript.png" alt="Mango NoSQL Injection Script"> <span>Results of my NoSQL injection script</span> </div>

<table class="htbTwoColumn">
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <th>Password</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>mango</td>
    <td>h3mXK8RhU~f{]f5H</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>admin</td>
    <td>t9KcS3>!0B#2</td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>
  Trying to log in to the page with these usernames and passwords succeeds, but we're only greeted by a "Under Plantation" message:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/underplantation.jpg" alt="Mango Under Plantation"> <span>Website after successful login</span> </div>

<p>
  Since this doesn't really lead anywhere, I try to login with the username-password combinations over <span class="htbTool">ssh</span>, which succeeds for the user <i>mango:</i>
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/ssh_mango.png" alt="Mango Successful login as mango over ssh"> <span>Successful login as mango over ssh</span> </div>

<h2 id="user">Exploitation - User</h2>

<p>
  Unfortunately, there's no <i>user.txt</i> in the home directory of <i>mango</i>, so it seems like we need to do some lateral movement to another user:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/mango_nousertxt.png" alt="Mango Home Directory of mango"> <span>Home directory of mango</span> </div>

<p>
  Checking out the <i>/home</i> directory reveals that there is not only a user called <i>admin</i> registered in the database, but also on the machine itself:
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/boxusers.png" alt="Mango /home Directory"> <span>The /home directory</span> </div>

<p>
  I try to simply change to the user <i>admin</i> by using the <i>su</i> command and the password I found earlier... and it works! After the surprisingly complex foothold step, this was quite easy :)
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/admin_usertxt.png" alt="Mango Admin user.txt"> <span>Reading the user.txt in /home/admin</span> </div>

<h2 id="root">Exploitation - Root</h2>

<p>
  To root the box, I first use my new privileges as the user <i>admin</i> and enumerate the box. While looking for <span class="htbTool">SUID</span> files with the command <i>find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null</i>, I see that <i>admin</i> can execute <span class="htbTool">jjs</span> with root permissions.
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/suid_jjs.png" alt="Mango SUID jjs"> <span>Checking for suid files</span> </div>

<p>
  <span class="htbTool">jjs</span> is a command-line tool that comes bundled with some releases of the Java Development Kit and allows for the execution of JavaScript code. <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/jjs/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTFOBins</a> has a page on <span class="htbTool">jjs</span> with some suggestions on what could work to escalate our privileges.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, simply spawning a shell doesn't work for me. However, I can use the suggested code for writing files to add my own <span class="htbTool">ssh</span> key to <i>root:</i>
</p>

<div class="htbImage"> <img src="../assets/htb/Mango/jjs_addkey.png" alt="Mango Adding own root ssh key using jjs"> <span>Adding own root ssh key using jjs</span> </div>

<p>
  I then simply connect to the box as <i>root</i> through <span class="htbTool">ssh</span> and I'm done!
</p>
