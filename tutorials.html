<h2>Hack The Box Write-Ups</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hack The Box</a> is an online platform focused on cyber security. It provides challenges in various fields of security to its members, like hacking virtual machines or <i>"boxes"</i> that were crafted for this purpose, cryptographic challenges and so on. Each challenge is retired after some time and users are encouraged to share how they solved retired challenges in <i>"write-ups"</i>. Below you find a list of my write-ups.
